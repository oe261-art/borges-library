      "He understood that modeling the incoherent and vertiginous matter of which dreams are composed was the most difficult task that a man could undertake.",
      "Much more difficult than weaving a rope out of sand or coining the faceless wind.",
      "Night after night, the man dreamt him asleep.",
      "So that his son should never know that he was a phantom… he destroyed in him all memory of his years of apprenticeship.",

      "This multiple god revealed to him that his earthly name was Fire.",
      "All creatures, except Fire itself and the dreamer, would believe him to be a man of flesh and blood.",
      "They did not bite his flesh, they caressed him and flooded him without heat or combustion.",
