      "The number of pages in this book is exactly infinite. No page is the first; none the last.",
      "I invited him in, pointing to a chair. He paused awhile before speaking. A kind of gloom emanated from him — as it does now from me.",
      "It was as though the book were a thing alive.",
      "I felt that the book was a monstrous thing.",
      "It was an octavo volume, bound in cloth. There was no doubt that  it had passed through many hands. Examining it, I was surprised by its unusual weight. On the spine were the words 'Holy Writ' and, below them, 'Bombay.' 'Nineteenth century, probably,' I remarked. 'I don't know,' he said. 'I've never found out.",
      "I opened the book at random. The script was strange to me. The pages, which were worn and typographically poor, were laid out in double columns, as in a Bible. The text was closely printed, and it was ordered in versicles. In the upper corners of the pages were Arabic numbers. I noticed that one left-hand page bore the number (let us say) 40,514 and the facing right-hand page 999.",
      "I turned the leaf; it was numbered with eight digits. It also bore a small illustration, like the kind used in dictionaries — an anchor drawn with pen and ink, as if by a schoolboy's clumsy hand.",
